### Viktor Zenk's BLD Trainer

Publishing this in a GitHub repo by request.
All the code is in the script tag in index.html.
simple.js is a library providing some easy-to-use canvas functionality.

I realize the code is not exactly easy to maintain (although it seems more structured than I remembered!). So yeah, feel free to clone/fork/whatever, I doubt I will be making any future updates on this.

The tool is deployed at [https://bldtrainer.netlify.app/](https://bldtrainer.netlify.app/)
